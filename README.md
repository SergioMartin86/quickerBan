[![Build & Tests](https://github.com/SergioMartin86/headlessOpera/actions/workflows/make.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SergioMartin86/headlessOpera/actions/workflows/make.yml)


headlessOpera is a standalone player for the [Libretro Opera](https://github.com/libretro/opera-libretro) 3DO emulator. The main aim is to integrate this work into Bizhawk.

  
All base code for this project was found under open source licenses, which I preserved in their corresponding files/folders. Any non-credited work is unintentional and shall be immediately rectfied.
